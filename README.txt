This app is a mashup of three API's; telize, panaramio, and googlemaps.  The user is at the mercy of the site and has little control over it.  The website automatically finds and displays the user's IP address from their local machine, along with any available geolocation data, via the telize API.  Based on the geolocation data, it then displays a widget containing pictures of places in your area using the panaramio API.  The user is able to click these pictures which by default link to the panaramio site where more information is provided.  Finally the google map of the area is rendered at the bottom of the page.  It is possible to see this site in action (the IP/geolocation data changing) by downloading an extension for your browser.  I use ZenMate, which I found on softonic.com.
